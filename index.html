                    Donald Arthur Norman (born December 25, 1935) is an American researcher, professor, and author.
                    Norman is the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego.He is best known for
                    his books on design, especially The Design of Everyday Things. He is widely regarded for his
                    expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science.[4] He is a
                    co-founder and consultant with the Nielsen Norman Group. He is also an IDEO fellow and a member of
                    the Board of Trustees of IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. He also holds the title of Professor
                    Emeritus of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Norman is an active
                    Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),
                    where he spends two months a year teaching.

                    Much of Norman's work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. His books all have the
                    underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a
                    controversial stance in saying that the design research community has had little impact in the
                    innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is
                    technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs. To this end, Norman named his website with the
                    initialism JND (just-noticeable difference) to signify his endeavors to make a difference.
